# Stacks and Queues
stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends
## Challenge
In this challenge, we did the basic operations of adding , deleting , find peek and check of empty for stack and queue.

## Approach & Efficiency
Simple methods have been taken to ensure big o time equal to o(1)
## API
adding , deleting , find peek and check of empty for each
