# Singly Linked List
 A linked list is a collection of nodes that together form a linear ordering. It takes many different forms and implementation.
 a singly linked list is a linked list where each node is an object that stores a reference to an element and a reference, called next

## Challenge
The challenge was to do Linked List, and then make 3 jobs:
1- Add an value
2- Make sure that there is a specific value
3- Return all values

## Approach & Efficiency
Well, there were many challenges to this challenge, but in general, the least complicated Approach was chosen

## API
1 - insert
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
2- includes
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
3 - to string
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List
